# Startup-Collaboration-And-Innovation-Platform
The entire platform was developed using the .NET framework with C# for backend operations. A SQL Server database is used to manage user data, startup submissions, applications, and other records. The frontend was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure a responsive and user-friendly interface.
